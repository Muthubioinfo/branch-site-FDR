# Statistical properties of branch-site test and FDR

This repository contains the files to recreate the analysis in Chapter 2 - Statistical properties of the branch-site test and false discovery rate to detect episodic positive selection.

To run the analysis, users are required to download and compile ```EVOLVER``` and ```CODEML``` programs available in ```PAML``` package, see [http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html). Use bash/LINUX commands to run PAML programs.

## Simulating codon alignments under different levels of positive selection
To simulate alignments codon alignments, one can use EVOLVER program to PAML package ```EVOLVER```.
